    This will start the javascript code to provide you a chart provided by the ApexCharts javascript library.

## Usage

### Page Header
**Refreshing data**: 
    Press the refresh button on the top left
**Add new chart**: 
    Press the "Add new chart" button to add a new chart to the page. By default 1 chart will be pre-loaded.
**Data Rate**: 
    The data rate by default is polling the site every second. You can change the number in the number box which will reflect in the charts (in seconds). Minimum of 1 second.
### Chart View
**Add Item**: 
    Press the "Add Item" button in order to add a new value to be plotted to the graph. A dropdown menu by default is provided to add the first item. Additional items will populate with a "X" button to remove the item from the chart.

#### Dropdown Menus
**Signal Type**: 
    This is a unique list generated from each dish.

**Target name/Spacecraft**: 
    This is a unique list of name (if signal type is target) or SpaceCraft (if signal type is up/down signal) generated by each of the selected signal type data sets. 

**Mnemonic**: 
    This is a unique list of attribute values within the selected signal type data sets. 

#### Saving Data

    Data can be downloaded from the graph by selecting the top right of the chart. This is through the ApexCharts toolbar. 
    The options are:
        Download PNG
        Download SVG
        Download CSV

#### Replotting the data

    To replot the data, it is recommended to save the CSV file after the realtime data needed has been plotted. In excel, you can select the data and "insert line graph" to view the plot again.

## On-going effort

### Time format in the csv download
    The csv does not export the time correctly

### yaxis scale setting 
    The Y axis scale is auto populated by the chart. Input fields are needed to provide min/max values for the chart.
